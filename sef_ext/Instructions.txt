This patch allows the integration of J!Research 1.1 with sh404sef component for friendly URLs
which can be downloaded from http://joomlacode.org/gf/project/sh404sef/frs/

Once you have installed the sh404sef component, you have to:

1. Move the com_jresearch.php file to [...]/components/com_sh404sef/sef_ext/
2. Move the file inside the plugins directory to [...]/administrator/components/com_sh404sef/language/plugins

Where [...] is the Joomla Root Directory.
